# Journey To Stripe
A folder that will highlight all the things i am learnig on my goal to working as an SE at Stripe
Everything I learn and any accompanying projects will be placed here. Either in folders or single files
The structure of the folder will also be updated in this readme

# How I am starting

- Make and distribute a package 
- Learn about testing
- Learn MySQL or a relational database
- Learn how to use it with Java
- Create simple applications
- Learn a Java Framework
- Remake applications made earlier in framework
- Learn a NoSQL DB
- Learn about Caching
- Learn about RESTful APIs (Make sure to read the part about REST from the original paper by Roy Fielding)

- Fundamentals of Backend Engineering
	> Using Hussein Nasser's course(Fundamentals of Backend Engineering) as a guide I plan to learn everything he has listed step by step.
	> I believe this is a good guide to gain an in-depth knowledge to the concepts a backend engineer is meant to know.
	> It will help me Understand backend communication design patterns, protocols, execution and proxying.
	> The list of things to learn in order are as follows:

	- Backend Communication Design Patterns
		1. Backend Communication Design Patterns Intro
		2. Request Response
		3. Synchronous vs Asynchronous workloads
		4. Push
		5. Polling
		6. Long Polling
		7. Server Sent Events
		8. Publish Subscribe (Pub/Sub)
		9. Multiplexing vs Demultiplexing (h2 proxying vs Connection Pooling)
		10. Stateful vs Stateless
		11. Sidecar Pattern
	- Protocols
		1. Protocols Intro
		2. Protocol Properties
		3. OSI Model
		4. Internet Protocol
		5. UDP
		6. TCP
		7. TLS
		8. HTTP/1.1
		9. WebSockets
		10. HTTP/2
		11. HTTP/3
		12. gRPC
		13. WebRTC
	- Many Ways to HTTPS
		1. HTTPS Communication Basics Intro
		2. HTTPS over TCP with TLS 1.2
		3. HTTPS over TCP with TLS 1.3
		4. HTTPS over QUIC (HTTP/3)
		5. HTTPS over TFO with TLS 1.3
		6. HTTPS over TCP with TLS 1.3 and 0RTT
		7. HTTPS over QUIC with 0RTT
	- Backend Execution Patterns
		1. Backend Execution Patterns Intro
		2. The Process and The Thread and how they compete for CPU time
		3. How The Backend Accepts Connections
		4. Reading and Sending Socket Data
		5. The Listener, The Acceptor and the Reader
		6. Single Listener, Acceptor and Reader Thread Execution Pattern
		7. Single Listener, Acceptor and Multiple Readers Thread Execution Pattern
		8. Single Listener, Acceptor, Reader with Message Load Balancing Execution Pattern
		9. Multiple Accepter Threads on a Single Socket Execution Pattern
		10. Multiple Listeners, Acceptors and Readers with Socket Sharding Execution Pattern
		11. Backend Idempotency
		12. Nagle's Algorithm
	- Proxying and Load Balancing
		1. Proxy vs Reverse Proxy
		2. Layer 4 vs Layer 7 Load Balancers
	- Extras
		1. How ChatGPT uses Server Sent Events
